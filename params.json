{"name":"Log4net-mongo","tagline":"Mongo appender for Log4Net.","body":"### Mongo Appender for Log4Net\r\n\r\nThis project provides a Mongo based buffering appender for Log4net. The code is split up into a two main branche. One is for general Log4Net usage and the other is a Sitecore branch for use in that product. This is because the Sitecore product uses specific versions of the Mongo Driver and Log4Net.\r\n\r\nThe core code uses Nuget and will also be available as a NuGet package. The Sitecore related code is currently available as code only due to the dependencies. To build the Sitecore related code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout sitecore-75\r\n```\r\n\r\nLonger term, the Sitecore branches will be replaced with assembly binding instructions and the core product will be available as a standalone Nuget package.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
